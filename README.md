<h2>About</h2>
This is a mock-up of the BBC news site. I completed this project to further my understanding about basic HTML,CSS,design principles, and basic css properties that
can be used to format a web page!

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
As you can see, the design closely follows BBC's current web page design (2019). The page consists of a a host of static links at the top of the page
which are followed by text form and search button. A nav bar is below this, various embedded videos, and an information section are below this.
Each section is separated by using divs and CSS styling!
